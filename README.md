## Yo ðŸ‘‹

I think this is a good place to give updates about myself. I don't know about you, but I find LinkedIn to be too formal lol. Getting started with a generic template ..
- ðŸŒ± I will start a Research Assistant position in the Agents and Simulated Reality department at DFKI SaarbrÃ¼cken in Feb'25. I hope I'll give more than my best! 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a RayTracer in C++, nothing too fancy but quite interesting...
- TBHâœ¨, I think about too many things, and there are many things I would want to work on. But in general generative AI, extended reality, and explainability are the topics I feel will have quite a big impact.
